    <h1>Hustling Is Only Way to Suceed</h1>

    <p>We get a lot of emails from men lamenting the fact that they feel stuck in neutral, and they ask for advice. Many
        of these men have great aspirations, but that’s all they have. Aspirations. Many don’t have any results to show
        for all their ambitious goals in life. Some are on year seven of a four-year degree, and others are stuck in a
        job that’s going nowhere. Maybe you know a man like this. Heck, maybe you feel like this.

        Unfulfilled goals, of course, can lead to frustration, depression, and just a general dampening of your man
        spirit, which only makes it harder to get unstuck. When we dig a little deeper into the lives of these “stuck”
        men, a few commonalities appear.

        First, there are the excuses. “The economy sucks.” “I’m not naturally smart/athletic/gifted.” “I don’t have
        enough time.” You get the idea.

        The second thing we often see is that they’ve just been doing the bare minimum to coast along in life. A lot of
        them think “showing up” constitutes real effort, and that the chips of their dreams will magically fall into
        place.

        We usually respond to these gents to stop with the excuses and start busting some ass. Some of these men take
        the advice to heart and get going. The others often counter with another excuse and ask for another way that
        doesn’t involve so much work

        These guys will never understand a very important truth: the world belongs to hustlers.

        Now, I’m not talking about hustling in the pulling-a-scam-on-the-naive-newbie sense. (Although it never hurts to
        have a little Fast Eddie swagger.) I’m talking about the
        work-your-ass-off-while-your-competition-plays-video-games kind of hustling. Hustling = doing whatever you have
        to do, for however long as you have to do it, until you reach your goal.</p>
